> The English language can not fully capture the depth and complexity of my thoughts. So I'm incorporating Emoji into my speech to better express myself. Winky face.

You know the way you feel when you see a picture of two otters holding hands? That's how you're gonna feel every day. My mother cried the day I was born because she knew sheâ€™d never be prettier than me. You should make me your campaign manager. I was born for politics. I have great hair and I love lying. Captain? The kids want to know where Paulie the Pigeon is. I told them he got sucked up into an airplane engine, is that all right?

You are the only one who knows yourself best. Everyone around you has different things to tell about you, but only you know your true self. There are billions of people on this planet, and every person has a different purpose. Each person finds their mission differently and has a different journey. Thus, when I write about myself, I write about my journey and what makes the person I am because of the trip. I try to be myself, be passionate about my dreams and hobbies, live honestly, and work hard to achieve all that I want to make.
